# About

We believe that entropy (which can be defined as a measurement of chaos, complexity) is inevitable, and equilibrium is death.
As product designers, developers, entrepreneurs, managers... it's our role to manage complexity.
We share on this blog our ideas and experience on how we tackle entropy and keep things simple.
